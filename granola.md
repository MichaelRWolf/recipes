## Adjustments & Notes

- Use scant salt and sugar.  
- Can replace some honey with maple syrup, but not all.  
- Added extra seasoning: extracts (vanilla, orange, maple), more cinnamon, ginger, cacao powder.  
- Michael prefers no fruit (it burns).  

*My honey loves me!*

## Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven**: Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325°F. Line an 8- or 9-inch square baking dish with parchment paper (overhanging sides for handles). Coat generously with nonstick spray.
2. **Toast Dry Ingredients**: Spread oats, nuts, sunflower seeds, and coconut flakes on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast until the coconut is lightly golden and nuts are fragrant, about 10 minutes, stirring once halfway through. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F.
3. **Combine Wet Ingredients**: Heat honey and peanut butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir until smooth and combined. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla, cinnamon, and salt.
4. **Mix Together**: Transfer the toasted oat mixture into the saucepan with the peanut butter mixture. Stir until evenly coated. Let cool for 5 minutes, then add chocolate chips (if added immediately, they will melt).
5. **Press & Shape**: Scoop mixture into the prepared pan. Press firmly into an even layer using the back of a spatula (or plastic wrap over top to prevent sticking). Remove plastic before baking.
6. **Bake**: Bake for 15–20 minutes — 20 minutes yields crunchier bars; 15 minutes gives chewier ones. While still in the pan, press a knife to score into desired bar sizes. Do not remove bars.
7. **Cool & Cut**: Let cool completely in the pan. Lift out using parchment and cut again along the same lines to separate bars. Pull apart and enjoy!
